# Keylight Controller

This is a desktop application to control Elgato Keylights. 


## Why?
As you may very well be aware, there are already desktop applications for Elgato Keylights, however like most Elgato/Corsair software there are not Linux alternatives, and since I daily drive linux, not having a way to control the lights via my desktop can be quite annoying. So I created this to solve my inconvience.
