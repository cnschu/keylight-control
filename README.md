# Keylight Controller

This is a desktop application to control Elgato Keylights. 

## Why?
As you may very well be aware, there are already desktop applications for Elgato Keylights, however like most Elgato/Corsair software there are not Linux alternatives, and since I daily drive linux, not having a way to control the lights via my desktop can be quite annoying. So I created this to solve my inconvience.

## Installation/Run
At this time the application is distrubuted via an [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) for maximum distro compatiblity so make sure you have AppImage installed/configured before hand (Most distros have AppImage installed by default). I am working on adding distro specific releases (deb/rpm) in the future. 

To download head [here](https://github.com/justinforlenza/keylight-control/releases/latest) and download the `Keylight_Controller-x86_64.AppImage` file.
